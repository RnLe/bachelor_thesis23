    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tf_agents.agents.ddpg import critic_network\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- We import the ``critic_network`` module, a predefined architecture for the Critic in DDPG from TensorFlow Agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Actor Network\n",
    "\n",
    "![Actor Network](../illustrations/actor_network_transparent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Actor network predicts the best possible action for a given state. Unlike other methods, in DDPG, this prediction is deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ActorNet(network.Network):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Predict the optimal action for a given state.\n",
    "- **Nature**: Deterministic. Always outputs the same action for the same state.\n",
    "- **Architecture**:\n",
    "    - Single fully connected layer (as of now).\n",
    "    - Uses a linear activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inner Workings\n",
    "\n",
    "- The network gets an observation (state) and processes it through its internal layers.\n",
    "- The output is reshaped to match the expected action's structure.\n",
    "- If necessary, the action values are adjusted (scaled/shifted) to fit within the valid action range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Critic Network\n",
    "![Critic Network](../illustrations/critic_network_transparent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Critic Network, in the context of DDPG, is used to estimate the Q-value of a state-action pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creation\n",
    "```\n",
    "critic_net = critic_network.CriticNetwork(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: The network takes two inputs – an observation and an action.\n",
    "- **Output**: Outputs a Q-value, estimating the expected return of that action in that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inner Workings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both the observation and the action are separately processed through their own neural network layers.\n",
    "- The outputs from these separate branches are then combined.\n",
    "- The combined output goes through one or more additional layers to produce the final Q-value estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architectural Details\n",
    "- **Initialization**: The network weights are initialized using the 'glorot_uniform' method, suitable for most deep learning scenarios.\n",
    "- **Layers and Parameters**:\n",
    "    - Separate layers for processing observations and actions.\n",
    "    - Joint layers to process combined data.\n",
    "    - Activation functions and other layer parameters can be adjusted for fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaway\n",
    "It's essential to ensure that the Actor network in DDPG outputs deterministic actions. It should not be confused with other methods where the policy network might output a distribution over actions."

    "In supervised learning, \"loss\" directly measures the difference between the predicted value and the actual value (e.g., how far off a predicted house price is from the actual price). In reinforcement learning, things are more indirect. The agent receives \"rewards\" from the environment based on actions it takes. Over time, it learns to maximize cumulative rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to \"learn,\" we typically use neural networks (or other function approximators) that need a scalar \"loss\" to perform optimization (i.e., adjust weights). The \"loss\" in RL is derived from the difference between expected rewards (Q-values from our networks) and the actual received rewards plus expected future rewards. In DDPG and similar algorithms, this is represented as the Temporal Difference (TD) error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"loss\" is then backpropagated through the network to adjust the weights, allowing the agent to make better action choices in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while the principles between supervised learning and RL are similar, in RL, the challenge and novelty lie in the fact that the \"correct answer\" (or immediate reward) might lead to sub-optimal long-term outcomes. Thus, the agent must learn to balance immediate and future rewards."

    "Understanding the nuances between ``sequence_length`` and ``num_steps`` is essential when working with the Reverb replay system in the TF-Agents framework. These parameters control how data is stored and sampled, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Storage with ``sequence_length``:\n",
    "  - When you set ``sequence_length=5``, the replay buffer will store experiences in chunks of 5 steps.\n",
    "  - Each stored sequence in the buffer will contain these 5 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Sampling with ``num_steps``:\n",
    "  - If you try to sample with ``num_steps=3`` from a buffer storing sequences of 5 steps, you can potentially retrieve any 3-step sub-sequence from within the 5-step stored sequences.\n",
    "  - This means you might get steps 1-3, 2-4, or 3-5, depending on the sampler strategy used.\n",
    "  - With a uniform sampler, each possible 3-step sub-sequence has an equal chance of being sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine storing experiences in 5-step sequences. If you then try to sample using ``num_steps=6``, you'll likely encounter an error since the buffer does not contain sequences of that length. Conversely, when sampling with ``num_steps=3``, you can extract any contiguous 3-step sequence from the stored 5-step experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's crucial to set these parameters with clarity on their roles:\n",

    "- ``sequence_length`` dictates how experiences are organized in storage.\n",

    "   - The `eval_actor` was previously instantiated using `actor.eval_metrics`. This procedure automatically includes some commonly used metrics to evaluate the efficacy of the policy:\n",
    "     - **Average Return**: It signifies the average sum of rewards accumulated while the policy operates within an environment over multiple episodes.\n",

    "   - The `eval_actor` runs to generate the aforementioned metrics.\n",
    "   - A ``dictionary`` named `results` is populated with metric names as keys and their corresponding outcomes as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Logging Metrics (`log_eval_metrics` function):**\n",
    "   - Designed for a clear and structured display of the evaluation metrics.\n",

    "   - The `get_eval_metrics` function is invoked to obtain the evaluation metrics.\n",
