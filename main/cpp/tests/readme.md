# Unit Testing in Project

Large projects can pose a variety of challenges, including complex debugging and code maintenance. Unexpected issues can occur from minor changes, potentially impacting a significant portion of the project's functionality. This can necessitate extensive code reviews and refactoring.

To address these challenges and ensure the reliability of the codebase, I've adopted a number of practices, including **Test Driven Development** (TDD). 

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is a software development approach in which unit tests are written before the code they're meant to validate. This method has a number of benefits, including:

- Encouraging simpler and more maintainable code.
- Reducing the time spent on debugging.
- Providing a reliable suite of regression tests that can catch future issues.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests play a critical role in TDD. These are simple tests written for specific, independent pieces of functionality within the code. In my project, I'm using Google's [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for unit testing. 

## Modular Coding

In modular coding, software is separated into independent modules, each handling a specific functionality. This approach provides a number of benefits, including:

- Improving readability and maintainability.
- Allowing for more efficient collaboration by reducing code conflicts.
- Facilitating more effective unit testing and bug fixing.

## Good Documentation

I understand the importance of comprehensive and up-to-date documentation for effective collaboration and maintenance. I aim to maintain clear documentation that can be a valuable resource for both current contributors and future developers.

By adopting these practices, I hope to improve the overall quality of my codebase and make the development process more efficient and enjoyable for everyone involved.
